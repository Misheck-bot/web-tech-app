# KidCoder: Teaching Children Basic Programming

This project is a full-stack web app to teach kids foundational programming ideas: sequencing, loops, and conditions. It combines short lessons, quick quizzes, and a simple playground where kids run pseudo-code.

How to run:
- Server: `cd server && npm run dev` (or `npm run build && npm start`)
- Client: `cd client && npm run dev`

Default API base: `http://localhost:4000`.

Demo credentials will be seeded: `demo@example.com / demo1234`.
